# BurnDown

Scrum burndown chart misc scripts

# Status

Concept

# Install 

copy paste and edit till it works

# Description

Misc project Idea because there is no burndown creator on the internet that is naive and thus only needs basic planning info (points to spend and available dates) to generate a simple chart for manual editing.

of other more relavant projects also see https://github.com/search?q=Burndown&type=Repositories

The shiny stuff doesn't work and maunal script should work but maybe needs some customising because it isn't interactive.
